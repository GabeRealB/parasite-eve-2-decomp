/// PE twin of `RoomsShared80180c98`: fills the "Play Data" PE-usage panel's
/// `RoomPeUsage` block from the save's per-slot use counters.
///
/// Each of the twelve Parasite Energy slots owns three consecutive ids starting
/// at 0xF, one per level, so slot `i` at level `Mc_SaveData.unknown_850[i]`
/// prints as `i * 3 + 0xF + level - 1` (a slot the player has never levelled
/// keeps the base id). Every slot with a non-zero counter in
/// `Mc_SaveData.field_862` - which really runs twelve entries wide, past the
/// seven the struct names - is appended and its counter summed. The ids are
/// then insertion-sorted by use count, most-used first, and each row gets
/// `percents`, its share of all recorded uses in hundredths of a percent, and
/// `barWidths`, its counter as a 12-bit fraction of the top row's. Both are
/// scaled down by halving until the top counter fits in 17 bits, so the
/// multiply and the shift cannot overflow.
