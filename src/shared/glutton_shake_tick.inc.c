/// Screen-shake driver for the enemy task: `func_actor_403200_8013FB54` writes a
/// level into `field_EAC`, and a change from the armed level in `field_EAD`
/// starts a shake of 5, 10 or 22 frames -- any other level is ignored. Each tick
/// spends one frame and drives `displaySetShakeY` off the frame counter's
/// low bits, so level 1 alternates 0 / 2, level 2 walks a four-frame 0 / 2 / 3 / 2
/// pattern and level 3 an eight-frame ramp that peaks at 4. The shake clears
/// itself once the counter runs out. Same body as
/// `func_actor_444000_8013A77C`, plus the null test on the work block.
